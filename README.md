# WebRock
This is just a simple website I made that simulates a social media and news platform for people who enjoy rock music.

### Website Breakdown

#### Index
On this page, we just have the overall elements of a classic index page, featuring the main objective and functions of the website.
<br>
I also simulated some news and posts from users and the staff of the website using Javascript.
<br>
<br>
*The news that I used here is actually real and I will link the original sources in the end of this description

#### Noticias
Here, we can see how the page of the news would work (I used the same news from the card on the index page).
<br>
I added a search bar and a button at the top of the "main" element of the html, just to simulate a way that users would search for the news inside the website.
<br>
Plus, I have also added a button to, supposedly, load more news.
