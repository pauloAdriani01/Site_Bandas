# WebRock
This is just a simple website I made that simulates a social media and news platform for people who enjoy rock music.

### Website Breakdown

#### Index
On this page, we just have the overall elements of a classic index page, featuring the main objective and functions of the website.
<br>
I also simulated some news and posts from users and the staff of the website using Javascript.
<br>
<br>
*The news that I used here is actually real and I will link the original sources in the end of this description

#### Noticias
Here, we can see how the page of the news would work (I used the same news from the card on the index page).
<br>
I added a search bar and a button at the top of the "main" element of the html, just to simulate a way that users would search for the news inside the website.
<br>
Plus, I have also added a button to, supposedly, load more news.

### Posts
Just like on the "Noticias" page, we can see how the page of the users posts would work (I used the same posts as the ones on the cards from the index page).
<br>
Also, similar to the "Noticias", I added a search bar and a button at the top of the "main" element in the html, just to simulate how users would search for posts on the website.
<br>
And last but not least, I also added a button to (supposedly) load more users posts.
